# Noto fonts

Noto’s goal is to provide a beautiful reading experience for all languages. It is a free, professionally-designed, open-source collection of fonts with a harmonious look and feel in multiple weights and styles. All Noto fonts are published under the [SIL Open Font License (OFL) v1.1](http://scripts.sil.org/OFL), which allows you to copy, modify, and redistribute them if you need to.

For background, technical details, and how to contribute, see the [FAQ](FAQ.md).

The fonts here are organized per script. Within each script directory there might be up to 5 subdirectories. These are:
* *font-v1x-ttf*: location of version 1.x fonts (they were issued as TTF only, but CJK)
* otf: current version of OTF fonts (same number of files as in the ttf directory below)
* slim-variable-ttf: Noto Variable Fonts might have multiple axis; this directory contains only Variable Fonts with a weight axis only "slimmed-down" to Regular through Bold range. (same number of files as in the variable-ttf directory below)
* ttf: current TTF fonts (same number of files as in the otf directory above)
* variable-ttf: current version of Variable Fonts (same number of files as in the slim-variable-ttf directory above)
